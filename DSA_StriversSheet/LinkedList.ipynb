A brute-force approach would be to traverse both the linked lists and compare each node of the first linked list with every node of the second linked list. But this approach would take O(n^2) time complexity. A better approach would be to use a hash table (unordered_set) to store the nodes of the first linked list, and then traverse the second linked list, checking if any of its nodes are already present in the hash table. If yes, then it is the intersection node.\n",
